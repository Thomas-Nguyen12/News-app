    "\n",
    "This will require using some clustering technqiue to group the articles into classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be specifying clusters according to popular news topics, such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Politics - Covers local, national and international political events, policies, and politicians. This is consistently one of the most read topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business/Economy - Includes financial markets, companies, industries, jobs, trade, and business leaders. Important for many readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Technology - Updates on innovations, new products, companies in the tech sphere. Widely appealing subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Entertainment - News about movies, music, celebrities, TV shows. Lights topics people enjoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sports - Reports on professional and college level competitions. Big fan following.\n",
    "\n",
    "- World - International affairs, events, conflicts and personalities from around the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lifestyle - Categories like food, travel, style, home that uplift readers’ lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Health - Medical research, wellness, fitness, conditions and treatments. Relevant to all.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Science - Covers discoveries, environment topics, and developments in diverse fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opinion/Editorials - Thought leadership pieces on current discussions and debates.\n",
    "\n",
    "some key examples include: \n",
    "1. Centroid-based clustering: This type of clustering uses the mean or median of a cluster’s points as the cluster’s centre or centroid. K-means is the most popular centroid-based clustering algorithm.\n",
    "2. Hierarchical clustering: This type of clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters, where each cluster is a subset of the next higher-level cluster. There are two main types of hierarchical clustering: agglomerative and divisive.\n",
    "3. Density-based clustering: This type of clustering groups together points that are close to each other in the feature space. DBSCAN is the most popular density-based clustering algorithm.\n",
    "4. Distribution-based clustering: This type of clustering models the data as a mixture of probability distributions. The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is the most popular distribution-based clustering algorithm.\n",
    "5. Spectral clustering: This type of clustering uses the eigenvectors of a similarity matrix to cluster the data.\n",
    "6. Neural network-based clustering: This type of clustering uses neural networks to learn the cluster structure of the data. Examples of this method are autoencoders and deep embedding clustering."
